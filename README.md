# Base64 Grep

Search for strings in base64 encoded data, without decoding it.
Especially for large blobs of base64 this can be significantly faster.

It is just an idea...
Probably gives false negatives, might give false positives.

## Usage

Search for a string in base64 encoded data, like `grep`:
```bash
cat file.b64 | base64grep 'search string'
echo 'Ba5e64E+C0D3D==' | base64grep 'search string' 
```

List all base64 encoded variants of a string:
```bash
base64variants 'search string'
```

Generate regular expression to search in base64 encoded data:
```bash
base64regex 'search string'
``` 

## Install

When using Bash:
```bash
cat base64grep.sh | tee -a ~/.bash_aliases
. ~/.bashrc
```

When using Oh My Zsh:
```bash
cp base64grep.sh ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/base64grep.zsh
omz reload
```

One time use:
```bash
source base64grep.sh
```

## Usage example: Spamassassin

This custom rule finds 'javascript' hidden in attachments, using the variants
generated by base64variants:

```bash
base64regex 'javascript'
```

```
full       T_JS_BASE64         /(amF2YXNjcmlw|phdmFzY3JpcH|qYXZhc2NyaXB)/
score      T_JS_BASE64         2.90
describe   T_JS_BASE64         Encoded javascript found
```
